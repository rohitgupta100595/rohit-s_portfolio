- Single Users buy bikes slightly more than married users.

- The highest bike purchases (259) come from adults in the average income group.
  - This could be due to balanced affordability and practical need (commuting, exercise).
  - Adults in this range may not afford cars or may prefer bikes for short-distance travel.
  - Strong alignment with working-class, urban lifestyles.
- Senior citizens buy significantly more bikes (93) in the average income group than in high (14) or low (15) income. 
  - This is because Average-income seniors may have disposable income for leisure or fitness-related biking.
  - High-income seniors may prefer more comfortable or less physically demanding transport. 
- Young adults are the lowest buyers across all income groups.

### Geographic and Professional Insights 
![](https://github.com/rohitgupta100595/Bike-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/7.jpg)
- North America has the highest percentage of bike purchases (46%).

  - Also, consumers may be more willing to invest in high performance motorcycles for long distance travel and touring.
  - North America’s high income allows consumers to spend more on high- end bicycle and motorcycles. 
- Pacific has lowest percentage of bike purchases.
  - This could be due to changing customer behaviour: Consumer are increasingly looking at motorcycles as leisure product rather than a primary mode of transportation, especially in some regions.
  - In some regions, poor road infrastructure can make riding motorcycles less appealing.
